## Using HuggingFace and LangChain for LLM alternative
Instead of OpenAI, I will be using HuggingFace. 

Details for environment setup can be found under the folder "pre-course workshop 1" -> "README.md". 

Sample code to call Huggingface LLM models can be found in the folder "pre-course workshop 1" -> "elastic-rag.ipynb".
